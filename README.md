# AI-Driven Handwritten Text Enhancement

## Project Overview
AI-Driven Handwritten Text Enhancement is a web application that allows users to input handwritten text and receive an enhanced version of it, correcting any spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues while maintaining the original meaning. The application uses the Gemini API for natural language processing and offers a sleek, user-friendly interface.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   You do not need additional installations as the project is client-side and uses CDN for dependencies.

3. **API Key Configuration**:
   Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `script.js` with your actual API key from the Gemini API to enable functionality.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Write or paste your handwritten text into the provided text area.
3. Click the **Enhance Text** button to submit your text for correction and enhancement.
4. The enhanced text will appear below. You can also copy it to your clipboard using the **Copy to Clipboard** button.

## Features
- User-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Integration with the Gemini API for advanced text processing.
- Ability to copy enhanced text directly to the clipboard.
- Error handling to manage and display issues during text enhancement.
